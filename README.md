# Word_counter

- Certainly, there are (many) programs that allow you to count the total number of words in a text, a specific word as it is written or as part of a larger word (if it is followed by changes in case, gender, or pronouns, i.e. if it contains prefixes or suffixes), one of them is Word (MS Office) where it can be done by pressing the `CTRL-F` combination.
- However, there is a program in front of you that allows you to do all of the above.
- The code was written with the help of the following programs:
  
1. `HTML` original code you can find here [HTML code](index.html)
2. `CSS` original code you can find here [CSS code](style.css)
3. `JS` code you can find here [JavaScript code](script.js)

> [!NOTE]
> When you enter the text and then the word or part of the word you want to count after clicking on the button `Count and Highlight Word` you will get the result, **but after 2 seconds from getting the result, in the case of long entered text and the late first appearance of the entered word, automatic scrolling to the entered word will begin!**
